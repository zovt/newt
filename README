NEWT
====

Newt is a lisp/scheme-like language with a focus on being useable
for real-time applications such as games, A/V processing, or OS-dev.

To accomplish this, Newt compiles to machine code, has no runtime,
and is easily interoperable with C.

Along with this, Newt is strongly statically typed, with type
inference.
